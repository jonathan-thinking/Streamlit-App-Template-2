# Streamlit-App-Template-2

This repository contains a template for creating Streamlit apps. The template provides a basic structure for building a Streamlit app, including a main Python file, a requirements document, a data folder for storing data, a pages folder for organizing the various pages of the app, a .gitignore file, and a Python file with UI settings.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
Streamlit
Additional dependencies listed in the requirements document

## Getting Started

## File Structure

main.py: This file is the starting point of the Streamlit app. It sets up the basic structure of the app, including the UI and navigation.
requirements.txt: This file lists the dependencies required to run the app.
data/: This folder is used to store any data required by the app.
pages/: This folder contains the Python files corresponding to each page of the app.
ui_settings.py: This file contains UI settings, such as the app name, for the Streamlit app.
.gitignore: This file lists files and directories that should be ignored by Git.

## Customizing the Template
The template is designed to be a starting point for your Streamlit app. You can customize the app by modifying the main Python file, adding additional files to the pages folder, uploading data to the data folder, changing the requirements, or modifying the UI settings in ui_settings.py.
